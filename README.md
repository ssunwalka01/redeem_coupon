### This Repo has 3 files: Documented _shubham_assignment, shubham_assignment, and Final_Assignment.

- `Final_Assignment` solution is where I have included a new parameter in LGBM for treating Class Imbalance Use Cases. Rest is same with `Documented_shubham_assignment solution`.
- In `Final_Assignment` after setting Class Imabalnce Parameter, the AUR-ROC score is 0.94, whereas in `Documented_shubham_assignment` it is 0.99. So, Former ssolution is better as the high accuracy in latter may be due to High Class Imbalance.
